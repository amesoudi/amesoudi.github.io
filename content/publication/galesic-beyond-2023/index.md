abstract: We develop a conceptual framework for studying collective adaptation in
  complex socio-cognitive systems, driven by dynamic interactions of social integration
  strategies, social environments and problem structures. Going beyond searching for
  ‘intelligent’ collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines and
  outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions such
  as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how they
  change their strategies and network structures in response to different problems
  and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal trajectories.
  We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and
  collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective
  adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful
  social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more
  complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our
  ability to organize in adaptive collectives.

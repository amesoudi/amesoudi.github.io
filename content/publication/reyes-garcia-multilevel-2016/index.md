abstract: Cultural adaptation has become central in the context of accelerated global
  change with authors increasingly acknowledging the importance of understanding multilevel
  processes that operate as adaptation takes place. We explore the importance of multilevel
  processes in explaining cultural adaptation by describing how processes leading
  to cultural (mis)adaptation are linked through a complex nested hierarchy, where
  the lower levels combine into new units with new organizations, functions, and emergent
  properties or collective behaviours. After a brief review of the concept of “cultural
  adaptation” from the perspective of cultural evolutionary theory and resilience
  theory, the core of the paper is constructed around the exploration of multilevel
  processes occurring at the temporal, spatial, social and political scales. We do
  so by examining small-scale societies’ case studies. In each section, we discuss
  the importance of the selected scale for understanding cultural adaptation and then
  present an example that illustrates how multilevel processes in the selected scale
  help explain observed patterns in the cultural adaptive process. We end the paper
  discussing the potential of modelling and computer simulation for studying multilevel
  processes in cultural adaptation.

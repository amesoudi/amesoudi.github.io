abstract: In this paper, we explore how experimental studies of cultural transmission
  in adult humans can address general questions regarding the ‘who, what, when and
  how’ of human cultural transmission, and consequently inform a theory of human cultural
  evolution. Three methods are discussed. The transmission chain method, in which
  information is passed along linear chains of participants, has been used to identify
  content biases in cultural transmission. These concern the kind of information that
  is transmitted. Several such candidate content biases have now emerged from the
  experimental literature. The replacement method, in which participants in groups
  are gradually replaced or moved across groups, has been used to study phenomena
  such as cumulative cultural evolution, cultural group selection and cultural innovation.
  The closed-group method, in which participants learn in groups with no replacement,
  has been used to explore issues such as who people choose to learn from and when
  they learn culturally as opposed to individually. A number of the studies reviewed
  here have received relatively little attention within their own disciplines, but
  we suggest that these, and future experimental studies of cultural transmission
  that build on them, can play an important role in a broader science of cultural
  evolution.

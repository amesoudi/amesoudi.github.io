abstract: A 'Darwinian Renaissance' in the social sciences and humanities cannot occur
  until evolutionary theory can successfully explain rapid and cumulative cultural
  change. Here I review empirical evidence that much of human behaviour is culturally
  determined, emphasising the need to incorporate culture into evolutionary analyses
  of human behaviour. I also review theoretical work which shows that culture is genetically
  adaptive, belying any simplistic gene-culture dichotomy. Finally, I show how recent
  work analysing culture as an evolutionary system is beginning to answer the kinds
  of questions that are of interest to social scientists and humanities scholars.
  These include phylogenetic reconstructions of the historical relationships between
  languages, manuscripts, social customs and artifacts, and experimental simulations
  of the microevolutionary processes underlying patterns of cultural macroevolution.

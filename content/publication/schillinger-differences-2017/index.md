abstract: A relationship between behavioral variability and artifactual variability
  is a founding principle of archaeology. However, this relationship is surprisingly
  not well studied empirically from an explicitly “microevolutionary” perspective.
  Here, we experimentally simulated artifactual variation in two populations of “artifact”
  manufacturers, involving only a single behavioral difference in terms of their “tradition”
  of manufacturing tool. We then statistically analyzed shape variation in the resultant
  artifacts. In many respects, patterned differences might not have been expected
  to emerge given the simple nature of the task, the fact that only a single behavioral
  variable differed in our two populations, and all participants copied the same target
  artifact. However, multivariate analyses identified significant differences between
  the two “assemblages.” These results have several implications for our understanding
  and theoretical conceptualization of the relationship between behavior and artifactual
  variability, including the analytical potency of conceiving of artifacts as the
  product of behavioral “recipes” comprised of individual “ingredient” behavioral
  properties. Indeed, quite trivial behavioral differences, in generating microevolutionarily
  potent variability, can thus have long-term consequences for artifactual changes
  measured over time and space. Moreover, measurable “cultural” differences in artifacts
  can emerge not necessarily only because of a strict “mental template” but as the
  result of subtle differences in behavioral ingredients that are socially learned
  at the community level.

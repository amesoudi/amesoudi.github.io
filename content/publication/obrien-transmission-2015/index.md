abstract: North American fluted stone projectile points occur over a relatively short
  time span, ca. 13,300–11,900 calBP, referred to as the Early Paleoindian period.
  One long-standing topic in Paleoindian archaeology is whether variation in the points
  is the result of drift or adaptation to regional environments. Studies have returned
  apparently conflicting results, but closer inspection shows that the results are
  not in conflict. At one scale—the overall pattern of flake removal—there appears
  to have been an early continent-wide mode of point manufacture, but at another scale—projectile-point
  shape—there appears to have been regional adaptive differences. In terms of learning
  models, the Early Paleoindian period appears to have been characterized by a mix
  of indirect-bias learning at the continent-wide level and guided variation at the
  regional level, the latter a result of continued experimentation with hafting elements
  and other point characters to match the changing regional environments. Close examination
  of character-state changes allows a glimpse into how Paleoindian knappers negotiated
  the design landscape in terms of character-state optimality of their stone weaponry.

abstract: Bentley et al.â€™s two-dimensional conceptual map is complementary to cultural
  evolution research that has sought to explain population-level cultural dynamics
  in terms of individual-level behavioral processes. Here, I qualify their scheme
  by arguing that different social learning biases should be treated distinctly, and
  that the transparency of decisions is sometimes conflated with the actual underlying
  payoff structure of those decisions.

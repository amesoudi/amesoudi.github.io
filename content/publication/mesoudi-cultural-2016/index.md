abstract: Cultural evolution represents a body of theory and findings premised on
  the notions that, (i), human cultural change constitutes a Darwinian evolutionary
  process that shares key characteristics with (but is not identical in details to)
  genetic evolution; (ii), this second evolutionary process has been instrumental
  in our species’ dramatic ecological success by allowing the rapid, open-ended generation
  and accumulation of technology, social institutions, knowledge systems and behavioural
  practices far beyond the complexity of other species’ socially learned behaviour;
  and (iii), our psychology permits, and has been shaped by, this cultural evolutionary
  process, for example, through socio-cognitive mechanisms such as imitation, teaching
  and intentionality that support high-fidelity social learning, and biases governing
  from whom and what we learn.

abstract: Popular music offers a rich source of data that provides insights into long-term
  cultural evolutionary dynamics. One major trend in popular music, as well as other
  cultural products such as literary fiction, is an increase over time in negatively
  valenced emotional content, and a decrease in positively valenced emotional content.
  Here we use two large datasets containing lyrics from n = 4913 and n = 159,015 pop
  songs respectively and spanning 1965â€“2015, to test whether cultural transmission
  biases derived from the cultural evolution literature can explain this trend towards
  emotional negativity. We find some evidence of content bias (negative lyrics do
  better in the charts), prestige bias (best-selling artists are copied) and success
  bias (best-selling songs are copied) in the proliferation of negative lyrics. However,
  the effects of prestige and success bias largely disappear when unbiased transmission
  is included in the models, which assumes that the occurrence of negative lyrics
  is predicted by their past frequency. We conclude that the proliferation of negative
  song lyrics may be explained partly by content bias, and partly by undirected, unbiased
  cultural transmission.

abstract: We present an agent-based computer simulation that extends a previous experimental
  simulation of the cultural transmission of projectile-point technology in the prehistoric
  Great Basin, with participants replaced with computer-generated agents. As in the
  experiment, individual learning is found to generate low correlations between artifact
  attributes, whereas indirectly biased cultural transmission (copying the point design
  of the most successful hunter) generates high correlations between artifact attributes.
  These results support the hypothesis that low attribute correlations in prehistoric
  California resulted from individual learning, and high attribute correlations in
  prehistoric Nevada resulted from indirectly biased cultural transmission. However,
  alternative modes of cultural transmission, including conformist transmission and
  random copying, generated similarly high attribute correlations as indirect bias,
  suggesting that it may be difficult to infer which transmission rule generated this
  archaeological pattern. On the other hand, indirect bias out-performed all other
  cultural-transmission rules, lending plausibility to the original hypothesis. Importantly,
  this advantage depends on the assumption of a multimodal adaptive landscape in which
  there are multiple locally optimal artifact designs. Indeed, in unimodal fitness
  environments no cultural transmission rule outperformed individual learning, highlighting
  how the shape of the adaptive landscape within which cultural evolution occurs can
  strongly influence the dynamics of cultural transmission. Generally, experimental
  and computer simulations can be useful in answering questions that are difficult
  to address with archaeological data, such as identifying the consequences of different
  modes of cultural transmission or exploring the effect of different selective environments.

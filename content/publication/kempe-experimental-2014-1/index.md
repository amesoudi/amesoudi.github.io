abstract: 'Cumulative culture is thought to have played a major role in hominin evolution,
  and so an understanding of the factors that affect cultural accumulation is important
  for understanding human evolution. Population size may be one such factor, with
  larger populations thought to be able to support more complex cultural traits. This
  hypothesis has been suggested by mathematical models and empirical studies of small-scale
  societies. However, to date there have been few experimental demonstrations of an
  effect of population size on cultural accumulation. Here we provide such a demonstration
  using a novel task, solving jigsaw puzzles. 80 participants divided into ten transmission
  chains solved puzzles in one of two conditions: one in which participants had access
  to one semi-completed puzzle from the previous generation, and the other in which
  participants simultaneously saw three semi-completed puzzles from the previous generation.
  As predicted, the mean number of pieces solved increased over time in the three-puzzle-per-generation
  condition, but not in the one-puzzle-per-generation condition. Thus, our experiment
  provides support for a hypothesized relationship between population size and cultural
  accumulation. In particular, our results suggest that the ability to simultaneously
  learn from multiple cultural models, and combine the knowledge of those multiple
  models, is most likely to allow larger groups to support more complex culture.'

abstract: Bows and arrows, houses and kayaks are just a few examples of the highly
  optimized tools that humans have produced and used to colonize new environments.
  Because there is much evidence that humans’ cognitive abilities are unparalleled,
  many believe that such technologies resulted from our superior causal reasoning
  abilities. However, others have stressed that the high dimensionality of human technologies
  makes them very difficult to understand causally. Instead, they argue that optimized
  technologies emerge through the retention of small improvements across generations
  without requiring understanding of how these technologies work. Here we show that
  a physical artefact becomes progressively optimized across generations of social
  learners in the absence of explicit causal understanding. Moreover, we find that
  the transmission of causal models across generations has no noticeable effect on
  the pace of cultural evolution. The reason is that participants do not spontaneously
  create multidimensional causal theories but, instead, mainly produce simplistic
  models related to a salient dimension. Finally, we show that the transmission of
  these inaccurate theories constrains learners’ exploration and has downstream effects
  on their understanding. These results indicate that complex technologies need not
  result from enhanced causal reasoning but, instead, can emerge from the accumulation
  of improvements made across generations.

abstract: Although acculturation psychology is extensively studied in the social sciences,
  research progress has slowed due to overused methodologies and theories and emerging
  challenges to core conceptual tenets. Here, we seek to stimulate scientific inquiry
  into acculturation by integrating underutilized cultural evolutionary perspectives.
  We propose that cultural evolutionary mechanisms, such as (anti)conformity, prestige
  bias, payoff bias, and vertical transmission are instrumental in understanding when,
  why, and how minority- and majority-group members acculturate. The direction and
  potency of these mechanisms are proposed to be modulated by a combination of contextual
  and individual factors, resulting in acculturation strategies that at the population
  level form “cultural evolutionary equilibria.” These equilibria in turn have consequences
  for the long-term, population-level dynamics of cultural evolution. We outline how
  our integration of perspectives can allow researchers to model the dynamics of large-scale
  cultural change, increasing our understanding of the complex challenges faced by
  today’s diverse societies. Public Abstract Acculturation describes the cultural
  and psychological changes resulting from intercultural contact. Here, we use concepts
  from “cultural evolution” to better understand the processes of acculturation. Cultural
  evolution researchers view cultural change as an evolutionary process, allowing
  them to borrow tools and methods from biology. Cultural evolutionary mechanisms
  such as conformity (copying the numerical majority), anti-conformity (copying the
  numerical minority), prestige bias (copying famous individuals), payoff bias (copying
  successful people), and vertical cultural transmission (copying your parents) can
  cause people to adopt elements from other cultures and/or conserve their cultural
  heritage. We explore how these transmission mechanisms might create distinct acculturation
  strategies, shaping cultural change and diversity over the long-term. This theoretical
  integration can pave the way for a more sophisticated understanding of the pervasive
  cultural shifts occurring in many ethnically diverse societies, notably by identifying
  conditions that empower minority-group members, often marginalized, to significantly
  influence the majority group and society.

abstract: ‘Learning’ is a process by which an individual gains new information. In
  the case of ‘social learning’, this process occurs because at least one individual
  has undertaken an activity that results in another individual learning something
  new. For an individual, therefore, ‘learning’ is an active process that takes place
  in vivo. For those faced with the challenge of studying learning in the Palaeolithic,
  however, all we are left with are inert objects (e.g., stone artefacts). Yet, understanding
  social learning during the Palaeolithic is a fundamental step toward understanding
  matters of our cultural evolution. Evolutionary biology, faced with similar problems,
  has made substantial progress in understanding matters of transmission, the effects
  of transmission on phenotypic variation, rates of mutation, etc. via the use of
  laboratory experiments, especially through the use of so-called ‘model organisms’.
  Here, we describe two experiments that use handaxe form in the manner of a ‘model
  organism’ in order to understand the effects of copying error. We go on to discuss
  why understanding these micro-evolutionary effects can ultimately lead to a greater
  understanding of learning dynamics in handaxe-making hominin populations. These
  experiments illustrate that the characteristic size and shape parameters of handaxe
  traditions will have been inherently unstable. In the case of shape, in particular,
  this suggests that a learning mechanism other than pure observation of others’ artefacts
  was used. Individual (trial-and-error) learning could conceivably constrain variation
  somewhat, but costs associated with knapping would encourage the adoption of social
  learning mechanisms that would countermand the inevitable effects of copying error
  with reduced risk to tool manufacturers.

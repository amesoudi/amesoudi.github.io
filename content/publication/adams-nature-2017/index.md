abstract: 'From an infant’s first grasp of quantity to Einstein’s theory of relativity,
  the human experience of number has intrigued researchers for centuries. Numeracy
  and mathematics have played fundamental roles in the development of societies and
  civilisations, and yet there is an essential mystery to these concepts, evidenced
  by the fear many people still feel when confronted by apparently simple sums. Including
  perspectives from anthropology, education and psychology, The Nature and Development
  of Mathematics addresses three core questions: Is maths natural? What is the impact
  of our culture and environment on mathematical thinking? And how can we improve
  our mathematical ability? Examining the cognitive processes that we use, the origins
  of these skills and their cultural context, and how learning and teaching can be
  supported in the classroom, the book contextualises each issue within the wider
  field, arguing that only by taking a cross-disciplinary perspective can we fully
  understand what it means to be numerate, as well as how we become numerate in our
  modern world.'

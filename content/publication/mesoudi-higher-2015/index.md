abstract: Cultural evolutionary models have identified a range of conditions under
  which social learning (copying others) is predicted to be adaptive relative to asocial
  learning (learning on one's own), particularly in humans where socially learned
  information can accumulate over successive generations. However, cultural evolution
  and behavioural economics experiments have consistently shown apparently maladaptive
  under-utilization of social information in Western populations. Here we provide
  experimental evidence of cultural variation in people's use of social learning,
  potentially explaining this mismatch. People in mainland China showed significantly
  more social learning than British people in an artefact-design task designed to
  assess the adaptiveness of social information use. People in Hong Kong, and Chinese
  immigrants in the UK, resembled British people in their social information use,
  suggesting a recent shift in these groups from social to asocial learning due to
  exposure to Western culture. Finally, Chinese mainland participants responded less
  than other participants to increased environmental change within the task. Our results
  suggest that learning strategies in humans are culturally variable and not genetically
  fixed, necessitating the study of the â€˜social learning of social learning strategies'
  whereby the dynamics of cultural evolution are responsive to social processes, such
  as migration, education and globalization.

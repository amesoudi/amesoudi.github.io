abstract: "Cultural change constitutes a Darwinian evolutionary process, comprising
  the three Darwinian principles of variation, selection and inheritance. Yet cultural
  evolution is not identical to genetic evolution: the sources of variation, the forms
  of selection and the modes of inheritance found in cultural evolution may be very
  different to those found in genetic evolution. Here, I review research conducted
  in the last 30 years that has built a Darwinian theory of cultural change by borrowing
  the rigorous, quantitative methods developed by biologists to explain biological
  evolution, yet simultaneously acknowledging the differences between cultural and
  genetic evolution. I argue that the quantitative nature of Darwinian methods (e.g.
  statistical analysis, formal models, laboratory experiments) has resulted in a significantly
  better understanding of cultural phenomena than many traditional non-evolutionary,
  non-scientific approaches to cultural change in the social sciences and humanities.
  Evolutionary theory also provides a synthetic framework within which different branches
  of the social sciences and humanities may be integrated, equivalent to the 'evolutionary
  synthesis' that integrated the biological sciences in the early 20th century."

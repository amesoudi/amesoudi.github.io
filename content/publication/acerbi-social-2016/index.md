abstract: The extensive use of social learning is considered a major reason for the
  ecological success of humans. Theoretical considerations, models and experiments
  have explored the evolutionary basis of social learning, showing the conditions
  under which learning from others is more adaptive than individual learning. Here
  we present an extension of a previous experimental set-up, in which individuals
  go on simulated ‘hunts’ and their success depends on the features of a ‘virtual
  arrowhead’ they design. Individuals can modify their arrowhead either by individual
  trial and error or by copying others. We study how, in a multimodal adaptive landscape,
  the smoothness of the peaks influences learning. We compare narrow peaks, in which
  solutions close to optima do not provide useful feedback to individuals, to wide
  peaks, where smooth landscapes allow an effective hill-climbing individual learning
  strategy. We show that individual learning is more difficult in narrow-peaked landscapes,
  but that social learners perform almost equally well in both narrow- and wide-peaked
  search spaces. There was a weak trend for more copying in the narrow than wide condition,
  although as in previous experiments social information was generally underutilized.
  Our results highlight the importance of tasks’ design space when studying the adaptiveness
  of high-fidelity social learning.

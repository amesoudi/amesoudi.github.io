abstract: "Suddendorf and Corballis (SC) claim that mental time travel has significantly
  affected human cultural change. This echoes a common criticism of theories of Darwinian
  cultural evolution: that, whereas evolution is blind, culture is directed by people
  who can foresee and plan for future events. Here I argue that such a claim is premature,
  and more rigorous tests of SC's claim are needed."

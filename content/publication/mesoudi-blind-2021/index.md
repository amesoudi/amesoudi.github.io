abstract: Many scholars have rejected cultural evolutionary theory on the grounds
  that cultural variation is directed and intentionally created, rather than incremental
  and blind with respect to function, as is the case for novel genetic variation in
  genetic evolution. Meanwhile, some cultural evolution researchers insist that cultural
  variation is blind and undirected, and the only directional force is selection of
  randomly-generated variants. Here I argue that neither of these positions are tenable.
  Cultural variation is directed in various ways. While this does not invalidate cultural
  evolution, more attention should be paid to the different sources of non randomness
  in culturally evolving systems.

abstract: 'Although the theoretical foundations of the modern field of cultural evolution
  have been in place for over 50 y, laboratory experiments specifically designed to
  test cultural evolutionary theory have only existed for the last two decades. Here,
  we review the main experimental designs used in the field of cultural evolution,
  as well as major findings related to the generation of cultural variation, content-
  and model-based biases, cumulative cultural evolution, and nonhuman culture. We
  then identify methodological advances that demonstrate the iterative improvement
  of cultural evolution experimental methods. Finally, we focus on one common critique
  of cultural evolution experiments, the appropriate individual learning control condition
  needed to demonstrate cumulative culture, and present an original experimental investigation
  relevant to this critique. Participants completed a combinatorial innovation task
  allowing for cumulative improvement over time in one of four commonly used experimental
  designs/conditions: social learners in chains, social learners in groups, individual
  learners experiencing an extended session lasting the same accumulated time as an
  entire chain or group, and individual learners experiencing repeated sessions adding
  up to the same total time. We found that repeated individual learning resulted in
  superior performance to any other condition. We discuss these findings in light
  of the relevance of the specific criticism of previous experimental studies that
  purport to have demonstrated cumulative culture. We also use our findings to discuss
  the broad trade-offs that participants face when learning individually and socially
  in different contexts, including variable acquisition costs, redundancy of effort
  in groups, and cognitive and motivational fatigue.'

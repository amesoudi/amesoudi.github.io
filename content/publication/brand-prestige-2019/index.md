abstract: Prestige and dominance are thought to be two evolutionarily distinct routes
  to gaining status and influence in human social hierarchies. Prestige is attained
  by having specialist knowledge or skills that others wish to learn, whereas dominant
  individuals use threat or fear to gain influence over others. Previous studies with
  groups of unacquainted students have found prestige and dominance to be two independent
  avenues of gaining influence within groups. We tested whether this result extends
  to naturally occurring social groups. We ran an experiment with 30 groups of people
  from Cornwall, UK (n = 150). Participants answered general knowledge questions individually
  and as a group, and subsequently nominated a representative to answer bonus questions
  on behalf of the team. Participants then anonymously rated all other team-mates
  on scales of prestige, dominance, likeability and influence on the task. Using a
  model comparison approach with Bayesian multi-level models, we found that prestige
  and dominance ratings were predicted by influence ratings on the task, replicating
  previous studies. However, prestige and dominance ratings did not predict who was
  nominated as team representative. Instead, participants nominated team members with
  the highest individual quiz scores, despite this information being unavailable to
  them. Interestingly, team members who were initially rated as being high status
  in the group, such as a team captain or group administrator, had higher ratings
  of both dominance and prestige than other group members. In contrast, those who
  were initially rated as someone from whom others would like to learn had higher
  prestige, but not higher dominance, supporting the claim that prestige reflects
  social learning opportunities. Our results suggest that prestige and dominance hierarchies
  do exist in naturally occurring social groups, but that these hierarchies may be
  more domain-specific and less flexible than we anticipated.

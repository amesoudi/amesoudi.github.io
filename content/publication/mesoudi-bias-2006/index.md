abstract: Evolutionary theories concerning the origins of human intelligence suggest
  that cultural transmission might be biased toward social over non-social information.
  This was tested by passing social and non-social information along multiple chains
  of participants. Experiment 1 found that gossip, defined as information about intense
  third-party social relationships, was transmitted with siginificantly greater accuracy
  and in significantly greater quantity than equivalent non-social information concerning
  individual behaviour or the physical environment. Experiment 2 replicated this finding
  controlling for narrative coherence, and additionally found that information concerning
  everyday non-gossip social interactions was transmitted just as well as the intense
  gossip interactions. It was therefore concluded that human cultural transmission
  is biased toward information concerning social interactions over equivalent non-social
  information.

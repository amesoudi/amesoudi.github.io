abstract: There is extensive evidence that adults, children, and some non-human species,
  represent routine events in the form of hierarchically structured 'action scripts,'
  and show superior recall and imitation of information at relatively high-levels
  of this hierarchy. Here we investigate the hypothesis that a 'hierarchical bias'
  operates in human cultural transmission, acting to impose a hierarchical structure
  onto descriptions of everyday events, and to increasingly describe those events
  in terms of higher hierarchical levels. Descriptions of three everyday events (going
  to a restaurant, getting up and going shopping) expressed entirely in terms of basic
  low-level actions were transmitted along ten chains each containing four adult human
  participants. It was found that the proportion of low-level information showed a
  significant linear decrease with transmission generation, while the proportions
  of medium- and high-level information showed significant linear increases, consistent
  with the operation of a hierarchical bias. The findings additionally provide support
  for script theory in general, and are discussed in relation to hierarchical imitation
  in non-human primates.

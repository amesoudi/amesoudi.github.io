abstract: It is often assumed in experiments and models that social learning abilities
  – how often individuals copy others, plus who and how they copy – are species-typical.
  Yet there is accruing evidence for systematic individual variation in social learning
  within species. Here we review evidence for this individual variation, placing it
  within a continuum of increasing phenotypic plasticity, from genetically polymorphic
  personality traits, to developmental plasticity via cues such as maternal stress,
  to the individual learning of social learning, and finally the social learning of
  social learning. The latter, possibly restricted to humans, can generate stable
  between-group cultural variation in social learning. More research is needed to
  understand the extent, causes, and consequences of this individual and cultural
  variation.

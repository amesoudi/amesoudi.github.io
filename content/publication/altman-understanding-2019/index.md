abstract: Since its emergence around 12,000Â years ago, agriculture has transformed
  our species, other species, and the planet on which we all live. Here we argue that
  the emergence and impact of agriculture can be understood within new theoretical
  frameworks developing within the evolutionary human sciences. First, the improvement
  and diversification of agricultural knowledge, practices, and technology is a case
  of cumulative cultural evolution, with successive modifications accumulated over
  multiple generations to exceed what any single person could create alone. We discuss
  how the factors that permit, facilitate, and hinder cumulative cultural evolution
  might apply to agriculture. Second, agriculture is a prime example of gene-culture
  co-evolution, where culturally transmitted agricultural practices generate novel
  selection pressures for genetic evolution. While this point has traditionally been
  made for the human genome, we expand the concept to include genetic changes in domesticated
  plants and animals, both via traditional breeding and molecular breeding. Third,
  agriculture is a powerful niche-constructing activity that has extensively transformed
  the abiotic, biotic, and social environments. We examine how agricultural knowledge
  and practice shapes, and are shaped by, social norms and attitudes. We discuss recent
  biotechnology and associated molecular breeding techniques and present several case
  studies, including golden rice and stress resistance. Overall, we propose new insights
  into the co-evolution of human culture and plant genes and the unprecedented contribution
  of agricultural activities to the construction of unique agriculture-driven anthropogenic
  biomes.

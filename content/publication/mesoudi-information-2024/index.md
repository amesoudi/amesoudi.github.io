abstract: Cumulative cultural evolution, where populations accumulate ever-improving
  knowledge, technologies and social customs, is arguably a unique feature of human
  sociality and responsible for our species’ ecological dominance of the planet. However,
  at the heart of cumulative cultural evolution is a cooperative dilemma. Assuming
  asocial learning is more costly than social learning, social learners can act as
  ‘information free-riders’ by copying innovations from asocial learners without paying
  the cost. This cost asymmetry will reduce innovation, inhibiting cumulative culture.
  Innovators might respond by protecting their knowledge and keeping the benefits
  to themselves – ‘information hoarding’ - but then others cannot build on their discoveries
  and again cumulative culture is inhibited. Here we formally model information free-riding
  and information hoarding within a cumulative cultural evolution framework using
  both analytical and agent-based models. Model 1 identifies the restrictive conditions
  under which information sharing can evolve in the face of information free-riding
  and hoarding. Models 2-4 then show how three mechanisms known to favour cooperation
  in non-informational contexts - kin selection, reputation-based partner choice and
  cultural group selection – can also solve the informational cooperative dilemma
  and facilitate cumulative cultural evolution, each with distinct signatures potentially
  detectable in historical, ethnographic and other empirical data.

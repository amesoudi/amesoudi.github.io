abstract: Cultural evolution theory posits that a major factor in human ecological
  success is our high-fidelity and selective social learning, which permits the accumulation
  of adaptive knowledge and skills over successive generations. One way to acquire
  adaptive social information is by preferentially copying competent individuals within
  a valuable domain (success bias). However, competence within a domain is often difficult
  or impossible to directly assess. Almost 20 years ago, Henrich and Gil-White (HGW)
  suggested that people use indirect cues of success (e.g., differential levels of
  attention paid to models by other social learners) as adaptive short-cuts to select
  models from whom to learn. They called this use of indirect markers of success prestige
  bias. In this review, we re-visit HGW’s proposal, examining the evidence amassed
  since for the adaptiveness and use of prestige bias in humans. First, we briefly
  outline HGW’s theory. Second, we analyse whether prestige is associated with competence
  within valuable domains, which is a crucial assumption underlying the adaptiveness
  of prestige bias. Third, we discuss prestige cues that people use to infer success
  (e.g., the amount of voluntary deference and attention received by models). Fourth,
  we examine the evidence for and against the use of prestige bias in human adults
  and children. Finally, we point out limitations in the current literature and present
  new avenues for research on prestige bias.

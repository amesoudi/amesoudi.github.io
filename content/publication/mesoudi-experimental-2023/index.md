abstract: This chapter reviews how experiments have played a growing role in the study
  of cultural evolution recently. Experiments occupy a middle ground between formal
  models and real-world observational and historical studies. Like models, they offer
  the advantages of control and manipulation in order to determine causal relations
  between variables. Like real-world studies, they involve actual human behaviour,
  albeit constrained within artificial boundaries. When interpreted within the context
  of this trade-off between external and internal validity, experiments can provide
  valuable insights into the processes and dynamics of cultural evolution. Given the
  centrality of social learning in theories of cultural evolution, experiments typically
  involve participants learning from at least one other participant. Various experimental
  designs have been employed including dyadic interactions, linear transmission chains,
  closed groups, replacement or migration methods, and economic games. Key findings
  relate to content and inductive biases that describe how the content of cultural
  traits affects their transmission and evolution; context biases concerning from
  whom traits are copied; studies probing the socio-cognitive and demographic factors
  that underpin cumulative cultural evolution; the burgeoning experimental study of
  non-human culture; and variation in learning strategies over the lifetime and across
  cultures. The chapter ends with some recommendations for future experimental research,
  including an awareness of the proper function and limitations of experimental methods;
  the need for closer links between experiments, theory, and real-world data; and
  the necessity for experiments to be both replicable and reproducible via open science
  practices, to ensure that new generations of scientists can build on reliable knowledge.

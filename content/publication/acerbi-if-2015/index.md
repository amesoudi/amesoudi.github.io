abstract: Cultural evolution studies are characterized by the notion that culture
  evolves accordingly to broadly Darwinian principles. Yet how far the analogy between
  cultural and genetic evolution should be pushed is open to debate. Here, we examine
  a recent disagreement that concerns the extent to which cultural transmission should
  be considered a preservative mechanism allowing selection among different variants,
  or a transformative process in which individuals recreate variants each time they
  are transmitted. The latter is associated with the notion of “cultural attraction”.
  This issue has generated much misunderstanding and confusion. We first clarify the
  respective positions, noting that there is in fact no substantive incompatibility
  between cultural attraction and standard cultural evolution approaches, beyond a
  difference in focus. Whether cultural transmission should be considered a preservative
  or reconstructive process is ultimately an empirical question, and we examine how
  both preservative and reconstructive cultural transmission has been studied in recent
  experimental research in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss how the relative
  importance of preservative and reconstructive processes may depend on the granularity
  of analysis and the domain being studied.

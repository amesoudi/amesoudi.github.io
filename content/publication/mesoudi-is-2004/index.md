abstract: The claim that human culture evolves through the differential adoption of
  cultural variants, in a manner analogous to the evolution of biological species,
  has been greeted with much resistance and confusion. Here we demonstrate that as
  compelling a case can now be made that cultural evolution has key Darwinian properties,
  as Darwin himself presented for biological evolution in The Origin of Species .
  Culture is shown to exhibit variation, competition, inheritance, and the accumulation
  of successive cultural modifications over time. Adaptation, convergence, and the
  loss or change of function can also be identified in culture. Just as Darwin knew
  nothing of genes or particulate inheritance, a case for Darwinian cultural evolution
  can be made irrespective of whether unitary cultural replicators exist or whether
  cultural transmission mechanisms are well understood.

abstract: Spatio-temporal patterns of artifactual variation are increasingly being
  studied via the explicit application of cultural evolutionary theory and methods.
  Such broad-scale (macroevolutionary) patterns are mediated, however, by a series
  of small-scale (microevolutionary) processes that occur at the level of individual
  artifacts, and individual artifact users and producers. Within experimental biology,
  “model organisms” have played a crucial role in understanding the role of fundamental
  microevolutionary processes, such as mutation and the inheritance of variation,
  in respect to macroevolutionary patterns. There has, however, been little equivalent
  laboratory work to better understand how microevolutionary processes influence macroevolutionary
  patterns in artifacts and their analysis. Here, we adopt a “model artifact” approach
  to experimentally study the issues of copy error (mutation) and resultant phylogenetic
  signal in artifact traditions. We used morphometric procedures to examine shape
  copying error rates in our “model artifacts.” We first established experimentally
  that statistically different rates of copying error (mutation) could be induced
  when participants used two different types of shaping tool to produce copies of
  foam “artifacts.” Using this as a baseline, we then tested whether these differing
  mutation rates led to differing phylogenetic signal and accuracy in two separate
  experimental transmission chains (lineages), involving participants copying the
  previous participant's artifact. The analysis demonstrated that phylogenetic reconstruction
  is more accurate in artifactual lineages where copying error is demonstrably lower.
  Such results demonstrate how fidelity of transmission impacts directly on the evolution
  of technological traditions and their empirical analysis. In particular, these results
  highlight that differing contexts of cultural transmission relating to fidelity
  might lead to differing patterns of resolution within reconstructed evolutionary
  sequences. Overall, these analyses demonstrate the importance of a “model artifact”
  approach in discussions of cultural evolution, equivalent in importance to the use
  of model organisms in evolutionary biology in order to better understand fundamental
  microevolutionary processes of direct relevance to macroevolutionary archaeological
  patterns.

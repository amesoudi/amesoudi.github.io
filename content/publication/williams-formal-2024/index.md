abstract: The emergence of social complexity in human societies is a long-debated
  topic in archaeology, with competing hypotheses proposed and argued for using archaeological
  evidence. However, formal testing of these hypotheses is generally lacking. Here,
  we present and analyse an agent-based model to test the effect of environmental,
  resource, and social barriers to population movement – collectively known as ‘circumscription’
  – on the rate of hierarchy formation. The results show that social circumscription
  is the largest driver of social complexity by increasing proximity between settlements.
  Environmental and resource circumscription can negatively impact the emergence of
  social complexity when the conditions separate the population spatially but can
  amplify social complexity when the conditions increase proximity between settlements.
  In providing a detailed test of the assumptions and predictions of circumscription
  theory, our abstract model provides insight into the conditions that are most likely
  to result in the emergence of social complexity in the real world.

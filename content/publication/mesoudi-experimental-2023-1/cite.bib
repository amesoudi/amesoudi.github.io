 abstract = {The aim of this experiment is to test reputation-based partner choice as a mechanism for maintaining open innovation in groups of social learners, and thus facilitating cumulative cultural evolution. By "open innovation" we mean innovating novel cultural traits at some cost, and allowing others to view and copy those novel traits. Partner choice involves people acquiring positive reputations for openly sharing knowledge with others. People would also preferentially select others with high reputations to share their knowledge with. Assuming knowledge translates to some measure of success, then partner choice would favour the emergence of open innovation: individuals who share knowledge with others acquire higher reputations and are more likely to receive knowledge from others, while individuals who refuse to share their knowledge fail to receive knowledge from others and are left with only private information. We aim to test experimentally whether participants follow these assumptions, and if so, whether open innovation emerges as a result.},

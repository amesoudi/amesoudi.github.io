abstract: 'The aim of this experiment is to test reputation-based partner choice as
  a mechanism for maintaining open innovation in groups of social learners, and thus
  facilitating cumulative cultural evolution. By \"open innovation\" we mean innovating
  novel cultural traits at some cost, and allowing others to view and copy those novel
  traits. Partner choice involves people acquiring positive reputations for openly
  sharing knowledge with others. People would also preferentially select others with
  high reputations to share their knowledge with. Assuming knowledge translates to
  some measure of success, then partner choice would favour the emergence of open
  innovation: individuals who share knowledge with others acquire higher reputations
  and are more likely to receive knowledge from others, while individuals who refuse
  to share their knowledge fail to receive knowledge from others and are left with
  only private information. We aim to test experimentally whether participants follow
  these assumptions, and if so, whether open innovation emerges as a result.'

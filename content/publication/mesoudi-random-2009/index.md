abstract: Previous evolutionary analyses of human culture have found that a simple
  model of random copying, analogous to neutral genetic drift, can generate the distinct
  power-law frequency distribution of cultural traits that is typical of various real-world
  cultural datasets, such as first names, patent citations and prehistoric pottery
  types. Here, we use agent-based simulations to explore the effects of frequency-dependent
  copying (e.g., conformity and anti-conformity) on this power-law distribution. We
  find that when traits are actively selected on the basis of their frequency, then
  the power-law distribution is severely disrupted. Conformity generates a 'winner-takes-all'
  distribution in which popular traits dominate, while anti-conformity generates a
  'humped' distribution in which traits of intermediate frequency are favoured. However,
  a more passive frequency-dependent “trimming”, in which traits are selectively ignored
  on the basis of their frequency, generates reasonable approximations to the power-law
  distribution. This frequency-dependent trimming may therefore be difficult to distinguish
  from genuine random copying using population-level data alone. Implications for
  the study of both human and nonhuman culture are discussed.

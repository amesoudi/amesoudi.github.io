abstract: "Copying errors that occur during the manufacture of artifactual traditions
  are potentially a major source of variation. It has been proposed that material
  items produced via 'additive' processes (e.g., pottery) will possess less variation
  than traditions produced via 'reductive' processes (e.g., stone knapping). The logic
  of this premise is that 'additive' production methods more readily allow for the
  reversal of copying errors compared to strictly 'reductive-only' processes. Here,
  we tested this hypothesis in shape data using an experimental framework in which
  we generated and statistically analyzed morphometric (size-adjusted) shape data
  under controlled and replicable conditions. Participants engaged in one of two alternative
  conditions: an irreversible ('reductive-only') manufacturing process or a reversible
  ('additive-reductive') process. With a number of factors held constant, participants
  were required to copy the shape of a 'target form' as accurately as possible using
  a standardized block of plasticine and a steel table knife. Results demonstrated
  statistically greater levels of shape-copying errors in the replicas produced in
  the reductive-only condition. This indicates that 'mutation rates' in the shape
  attributes of artifactual traditions produced via reductive processes are inherently
  greater than those produced via alternative means. Several implications for the
  study of variation in artifactual traditions are discussed."

abstract: We applaud Gintis's attempt to provide an evolutionary-based framework for
  the behavioral sciences, and note a number of similarities with our own recent cultural
  evolutionary structure for the social sciences. Gintis's proposal would be further
  strengthened by a greater emphasis on additional methods to evolutionary game theory,
  clearer empirical predictions, and a broader consideration of cultural transmission.

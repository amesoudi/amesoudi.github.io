abstract: Social learning (learning from others) is evolutionarily adaptive under
  a wide range of conditions and is a long-standing area of interest across the social
  and biological sciences. One social-learning mechanism derived from cultural evolutionary
  theory is prestige bias, which allows a learner in a novel environment to quickly
  and inexpensively gather information as to the potentially best teachers, thus maximizing
  his or her chances of acquiring adaptive behavior. Learners provide deference to
  high-status individuals in order to ingratiate themselves with, and gain extended
  exposure to, that individual. We examined prestige-biased social transmission in
  a laboratory experiment in which participants designed arrowheads and attempted
  to maximize hunting success, measured in caloric return. Our main findings are that
  (1) participants preferentially learned from prestigious models (defined as those
  models at whom others spent longer times looking), and (2) prestige information
  and success-related information were used to the same degree, even though the former
  was less useful in this experiment than the latter. We also found that (3) participants
  were most likely to use social learning over individual (asocial) learning when
  they were performing poorly, in line with previous experiments, and (4) prestige
  information was not used more often following environmental shifts, contrary to
  predictions. These results support previous discussions of the key role that prestige-biased
  transmission plays in social learning.

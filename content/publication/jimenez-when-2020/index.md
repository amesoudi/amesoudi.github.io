abstract: 'Previous research has sought to explain the rise of right-wing populist
  leaders in terms of the evolutionary framework of dominance and prestige. In this
  framework, dominance is defined as high social rank acquired via coercion and fear,
  and prestige is defined as high social rank acquired via competence and admiration.
  Previous studies have shown that right-wing populist leaders are rated as more dominant
  than non-populist leaders, and right-wing populist / dominant leaders are favoured
  in times of economic uncertainty and intergroup conflict. In this paper we explore
  and critique this application of dominance-prestige to politics. First, we argue
  that the dominance-prestige framework, originally developed to explain inter-personal
  relationships within small-scale societies characterised by face-to-face interaction,
  does not straightforwardly extend to large-scale democratic societies which have
  frequent anonymous interaction and complex ingroup-outgroup dynamics. Second, we
  show that economic uncertainty and intergroup conflict predict not only preference
  for dominant leaders, but also prestigious leaders. Third, we show that perceptions
  of leaders as dominant or prestigious are not fixed, and depend on the political
  ideology of the perceiver: people view leaders who share their ideology as prestigious,
  and who oppose their ideology as dominant, whether that ideology is liberal or conservative.
  Fourth, we show that political ideology is a stronger predictor than economic uncertainty
  of preference for Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential Election,
  contradicting previous findings that link Trump’s success to economic uncertainty.
  We conclude by suggesting that, if economic uncertainty does not directly affect
  preferences for right-wing populist leaders, other features of their discourse such
  as higher emotionality might explain their success.'

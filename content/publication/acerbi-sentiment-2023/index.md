abstract: The role of nature documentaries in shaping public attitudes and behavior
  toward conservation and wildlife issues is unclear. We analyzed the emotional content
  of over 2 million tweets related to Our Planet, a major nature documentary released
  on Netflix, with dictionary and rule-based automatic sentiment analysis. We also
  compared the sentiment associated with species mentioned in Our Planet and a set
  of control species with similar features but not mentioned in the documentary. Tweets
  were largely negative in sentiment at the time of release of the series. This effect
  was primarily linked to the highly skewed distributions of retweets and, in particular,
  to a single negatively valenced and massively retweeted tweet (textgreater150,000
  retweets). Species mentioned in Our Planet were associated with more negative sentiment
  than the control species, and this effect coincided with a short period following
  the airing of the series. Our results are consistent with a general negativity bias
  in cultural transmission and document the difficulty of evoking positive sentiment,
  on social media and elsewhere, in response to environmental problems.

abstract: Cultural evolutionary theory is an interdisciplinary field in which human
  culture is viewed as a Darwinian process of variation, competition, and inheritance,
  and the tools, methods, and theories developed by evolutionary biologists to study
  genetic evolution are adapted to study cultural change. It is argued here that an
  integration of the theories and findings of mainstream social psychology and of
  cultural evolutionary theory can be mutually beneficial. Social psychology provides
  cultural evolution with a set of empirically verified microevolutionary cultural
  processes, such as conformity, model-based biases, and content biases, that are
  responsible for specific patterns of cultural change. Cultural evolutionary theory
  provides social psychology with ultimate explanations for, and an understanding
  of the population-level consequences of, many social psychological phenomena, such
  as social learning, conformity, social comparison, and intergroup processes, as
  well as linking social psychology with other social science disciplines such as
  cultural anthropology, archaeology, and sociology.

abstract: An emerging idea in evolutionary biology is that inheritance implies more
  than the sole transmission of the DNA sequence across generations. Non-genetic inheritance
  of information across generations results from various processes that contribute
  to parent–offspring resemblance, a property that is called heritability.The concept
  of heritability has been generalized into that of inclusive heritability, which
  is the heredity of differences, including all forms of inheritance. It unifies genetic
  and non-genetic heritability into a single framework encompassing the multiple dimensions
  of inheritance. We briefly provide evidence for the four identified processes of
  non-genetic inheritance.Epigenetic changes in DNA expression result in epigenetic
  inheritance when they are transmitted across generations, thus contributing to the
  transgenerational transmission of phenotypic variation. Epigenetic changes are usually
  mediated by changes in environmental conditions. Examples include the inheritance
  of maternal behaviour in rodents or the inheritance of flower symmetry.Parental
  non-genetic effects can result in the inheritance of non-genetic information across
  generations, thus contributing to the non-genetic component of inclusive heritability.
  Examples include the inheritance of immunocompetence against given parasites in
  birds or flexible adaptation to the maternal light environment in plants.Ecological
  inheritance occurs when offspring inherit the habitat of their parents. This indicates
  that any modification of the environment that results from ancestral activity and
  that affects fitness will change subsequent selective pressures. Examples include
  the webs, nests, dams and burrows that numerous animal species create, but also
  the changes in atmospheric gases and soil nutrients brought about by bacteria and
  plant species.Culture is the part of phenotypic variance that is transmitted through
  social learning. Recent evidence suggests that cultural transmission is widespread
  among animals. Examples concern mate choice and species recognition. Cultural selection
  constitutes another engine of evolution when it interacts with natural selection
  in both animals and humans.Non-genetic inheritance can easily be confounded with
  genetic inheritance. It is the intricate network of genetic and non-genetic inheritance
  systems that produce parent–offspring resemblance, which constitutes the whole evolutionary
  potential of a trait quantified by inclusive heritability.We formally partition
  inclusive heritability and propose methods to disentangle its components in order
  to better integrate them into a comprehensive view of inheritance. We propose specific
  designs coupling field or experimental longitudinal data with animal model types
  of statistical tools.Such methods should help to unravel fascinating enigmas in
  evolution and medicine, such as major evolutionary transitions or the 'missing heritability'
  in the human genome.The time is ripe to broaden concepts of inheritance and heritability
  in order to fully grasp the richness of evolutionary processes, and we call for
  a multidimensional modern synthesis that would merge the current modern synthesis
  with an inclusive view of inheritance.

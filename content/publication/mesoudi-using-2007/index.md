abstract: 'Cultural psychology, and other social sciences (e.g. cultural anthropology,
  sociology), seek to document cultural variation, yet have difficulty providing strong
  empirical tests of explanations for that variation. It is argued here that an effective
  means of testing hypotheses regarding the origin of, and persistence and change
  in, cultural variation is by simulating cultural transmission in the lab using certain
  methods from experimental social psychology. Three experimental methods are reviewed:
  the transmission chain method, the replacement method, and the constant-group method.
  Although very few studies have explicitly simulated specific cross-cultural patterns,
  much potential exists for future investigations. This integration of small-scale
  experimental simulations and large-scale observational or historical data is facilitated
  by an evolutionary framework for the study of culture, and has a precedent in the
  biological sciences, where experiments are used to simulate and explain the processes
  of biological evolution.'

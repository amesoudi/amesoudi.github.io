abstract: Prestige-biased social learning (henceforth “prestige-bias”) occurs when
  individuals predominantly choose to learn from a prestigious member of their group,
  i.e. someone who has gained attention, respect and admiration for their success
  in some domain. Prestige-bias is proposed as an adaptive social-learning strategy
  as it provides a short-cut to identifying successful group members, without having
  to assess each person’s success individually. Previous work has documented prestige-bias
  and verified that it is used adaptively. However, the domain-specificity and generality
  of prestige-bias has not yet been explicitly addressed experimentally. By domain-specific
  prestige-bias we mean that individuals choose to learn from a prestigious model
  only within the domain of expertise in which the model acquired their prestige.
  By domain-general prestige-bias we mean that individuals choose to learn from prestigious
  models in general, regardless of the domain in which their prestige was earned.
  To distinguish between domain specific and domain general prestige we ran an online
  experiment (n = 397) in which participants could copy each other to score points
  on a general-knowledge quiz with varying topics (domains). Prestige in our task
  was an emergent property of participants’ copying behaviour. We found participants
  overwhelmingly preferred domain-specific (same topic) prestige cues to domain-general
  (across topic) prestige cues. However, when only domain-general or cross-domain
  (different topic) cues were available, participants overwhelmingly favoured domain-general
  cues. Finally, when given the choice between cross-domain prestige cues and randomly
  generated Player IDs, participants favoured cross-domain prestige cues. These results
  suggest participants were sensitive to the source of prestige, and that they preferred
  domain-specific cues even though these cues were based on fewer samples (being calculated
  from one topic) than the domain-general cues (being calculated from all topics).
  We suggest that the extent to which people employ a domain-specific or domain-general
  prestige-bias may depend on their experience and understanding of the relationships
  between domains.

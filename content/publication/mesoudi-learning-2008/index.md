abstract: Archaeologists have proposed that behavioral knowledge of a tool can be
  conceptualized as a 'recipe'—a unit of cultural transmission that combines the preparation
  of raw materials, construction, and use of the tool, and contingency plans for repair
  and maintenance. This parallels theories in cognitive psychology that behavioral
  knowledge is hierarchically structured—sequences of actions are divided into higher
  level, partially independent subunits. Here we use an agent-based simulation model
  to explore the costs and benefits of hierarchical learning relative to holistic
  learning, where entire behavioral sequences are learned in an all-or-nothing fashion,
  and diffusionist learning, where actions are completely independent. Hierarchical
  learning is favored under the reasonable assumptions that learning is associated
  with some degree of both error and cost, and that behavior can be grouped into subunits
  that repeat in one or more tool recipes. These general predictions can be tested
  in the archaeological and ethnographic record. Recent advances in evolutionary developmental
  biology have revealed a number of parallels between the hierarchically structured,
  recipe-like organization of behavioral knowledge that we examine here and the manner
  in which biological organisms develop.

abstract: 'Individual-Based Models of Cultural Evolution shows readers how to create
  individual-based models of cultural evolution using the programming language R.
  The field of cultural evolution has emerged in the last few decades as a thriving,
  interdisciplinary effort to understand cultural change and cultural diversity within
  an evolutionary framework and using evolutionary tools, concepts, and methods.   Given
  its roots in evolutionary biology, much of cultural evolution is grounded in, or
  inspired by, formal models. Yet many researchers interested in cultural evolution
  come from backgrounds that lack training in formal modelling, such as psychology,
  anthropology or archaeology. This book addresses that gap. It provides example code
  in R for readers to run their own models, moving from very simple models of the
  basic processes of cultural evolution, such as biased transmission and cultural
  mutation, to more advanced topics such as the evolution of social learning, demographic
  effects, and social network analysis.   Features of this book:   Recreates existing
  models in the literature to show how these were created and to enable readers to
  have a better understanding of their significance and how to apply them to their
  own research questions   Provides full R code to realize models and analyse and
  plot outputs, with line-by-line analysis   Requires no previous knowledge of the
  field of cultural evolution, and only very basic programming knowledge   This is
  an essential resource for researchers and students interested in cultural evolution,
  including disciplines such as psychology, anthropology, archaeology, and biology
  as well as sociology and digital humanities.'

abstract: 'We advocate and share the same theoretical framework for empirical research
  in ethics as exemplified in Christina Bicchieri’s The Grammar of Society. Our research
  differs from Bicchieri’s in our approach to experimentation: where she relies on
  lab experiments, we have constructed an experimental platform based on an internet
  survey instrument; where she relies on rational reconstructions, we do not. In this
  paper we focus on four contrasts in our methods: (1) we provide a space to explore
  ethical influence and norm transmission between participants, belief and choice
  revision, and reputation over time; (2) we provide ways for participants to expand
  the context of their and others’ decisions; (3) we focus on more realistic ethical
  decisions than is allowed by games; and (4) we explain why Bicchieri’s method of
  rational reconstructions presents challenges to her theory of social norms. Our
  methods are complementary to Bicchieri’s, and together we can work toward developing
  more comprehensive empirically informed ethics.'

abstract: 'Cultural psychologists have shown that people from Western, Educated, Industrialised,
  Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) countries often exhibit different psychological processing
  to people from less-WEIRD countries. The former exhibit more individualistic and
  less collectivistic social orientation, and more analytic and less holistic cognition,
  than non-Westerners. Yet the mechanisms responsible for maintaining this cultural
  variation are unclear. Immigration is an ideal ‘natural experiment’ for uncovering
  such mechanisms. We used a battery of psychological measures previously shown to
  vary cross-culturally to compare the social orientation and cognitive style of 286
  residents of East London from three cultural backgrounds: (i) 1 st -generation British
  Bangladeshi immigrants; (ii) 2 nd -generation British Bangladeshis raised in the
  UK to Bangladeshi-raised parents; and (iii) non-migrants whose parents were born
  and raised in the UK. Model comparison revealed that individualism and dispositional
  attribution, typical of Western societies, are driven primarily by horizontal cultural
  transmission (e.g. via mass media), with parents and other family members having
  little or no effect, while collectivism, social closeness and situational attribution
  were driven by a mix of vertical/oblique cultural transmission (e.g. via family
  contact) and horizontal cultural transmission. These individual-level transmission
  dynamics can explain hitherto puzzling population-level phenomena, such as the partial
  acculturation of 2 nd -generation immigrants on measures such as collectivism (due
  to the mix of vertical and horizontal cultural transmission), or the observation
  in several countries of increasing individualism (which is transmitted horizontally
  and therefore rapidly) despite little corresponding change in collectivism (which
  is transmitted partly vertically and therefore more slowly). Further consideration
  of cultural transmission mechanisms, in conjunction with the study of migrant communities
  and model comparison statistics, can shed light on the persistence of, and changes
  in, culturally-variable psychological processes.'

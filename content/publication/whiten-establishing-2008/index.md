abstract: A growing set of observational studies documenting putative cultural variations
  in wild animal populations has been complemented by experimental studies that can
  more rigorously distinguish between social and individual learning. However, these
  experiments typically examine only what one animal learns from another. Since the
  spread of culture is inherently a group-level phenomenon, greater validity can be
  achieved through ‘diffusion experiments’, in which founder behaviours are experimentally
  manipulated and their spread across multiple individuals tested. Here we review
  the existing corpus of 33 such studies in fishes, birds, rodents and primates and
  offer the first systematic analysis of the diversity of experimental designs that
  have arisen. We distinguish three main transmission designs and seven different
  experimental/control approaches, generating an array with 21 possible cells, 15
  of which are currently represented by published studies. Most but not all of the
  adequately controlled diffusion experiments have provided robust evidence for cultural
  transmission in at least some taxa, with transmission spreading across populations
  of up to 24 individuals and along chains of up to 14 transmission events. We survey
  the achievements of this work, its prospects for the future and its relationship
  to diffusion studies with humans discussed in this theme issue and elsewhere.

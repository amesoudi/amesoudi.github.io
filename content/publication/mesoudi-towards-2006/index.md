abstract: We suggest that human culture exhibits key Darwinian evolutionary properties,
  and argue that the structure of a science of cultural evolution should share fundamental
  features with the structure of the science of biological evolution. This latter
  claim is tested by outlining the methods and approaches employed by the principal
  subdisciplines of evolutionary biology and assessing whether there is an existing
  or potential corresponding approach to the study of cultural evolution. Existing
  approaches within anthropology and archaeology demonstrate a good match with the
  macroevolutionary methods of systematics, paleobiology, and biogeography, whereas
  mathematical models derived from population genetics have been successfully developed
  to study cultural microevolution. Much potential exists for experimental simulations
  and field studies of cultural microevolution, where there are opportunities to borrow
  further methods and hypotheses from biology. Potential also exists for the cultural
  equivalent of molecular genetics in 'social cognitive neuroscience,' although many
  fundamental issues have yet to be resolved. It is argued that studying culture within
  a unifying evolutionary framework has the potential to integrate a number of separate
  disciplines within the social sciences.

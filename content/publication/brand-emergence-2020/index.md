abstract: Prestige-biased social learning occurs when individuals preferentially learn
  from others who are highly respected, admired, copied, or attended to in their group.
  This form of social learning is argued to reflect novel forms of social hierarchy
  in human societies, and, by providing an efficient short-cut to acquiring adaptive
  information, underpin the cumulative cultural evolution that has contributed to
  our species’ ecological success. Despite these potentially important consequences,
  little empirical work to date has tested the basic predictions of prestige-biased
  social learning. Here we provide evidence supporting the key predictions that prestige-biased
  social learning is used when it constitutes an indirect cue of success, and when
  success-biased social learning is unavailable. We ran an online experiment (n = 269)
  in which participants could copy each other in real-time to score points on a general-knowledge
  quiz. Our implementation of ‘prestige’ was the number of times someone had previously
  been copied by others. Importantly, prestige was an emergent property of participants’
  behaviour during the experiment; no deception or manipulation of prestige was employed
  at any time. We found that, as predicted, participants used prestige-biased social
  learning when the prestige cue was an indirect cue of success, and when direct success
  information was unavailable. This highlights how people flexibly and adaptively
  employ social learning strategies based on the reliability of the information that
  such strategies provide.

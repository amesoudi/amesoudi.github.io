abstract: Informal social hierarchies within small human groups are argued to be based
  on prestige, dominance, or a combination of the two (Henrich & Gil-White, 2001).
  Prestige-based hierarchies entail the ordering of individuals by the admiration
  and respect they receive from others due to their competence within valued domains.
  This type of hierarchy provides benefits for subordinates such as social learning
  opportunities and both private and public goods. In contrast, dominance-based hierarchies
  entail the ordering of individuals by their capacity to win fights, and coerce or
  intimidate others. This type of hierarchy produces costs in subordinates due to
  its aggressive and intimidating nature. Given the benefits and costs associated
  with these types of social hierarchies for subordinates, we hypothesised that prestige
  and dominance cues are better recalled and transmitted than social rank cues that
  do not elicit high prestige or dominance associations (i.e. medium social rank cues).
  Assuming that for the majority of the population who are not already at the top
  of the social hierarchy it is more important to avoid the costs of dominance-based
  hierarchies than to obtain the benefits of prestige-based hierarchies, we further
  hypothesised that dominance cues are better transmitted than prestige cues. We conducted
  a recall-based transmission chain experiment with 30 chains of four generations
  each (N = 120). Participants read and recalled descriptions of prestigious, dominant,
  and medium social rank footballers, and their recall was passed to the next participant
  within their chain. As predicted, we found that both prestige cues and dominance
  cues were better transmitted than medium social rank cues. However, we did not find
  support for our prediction of the better transmission of dominance cues than prestige
  cues. We discuss whether the results might be explained by a specific social-rank
  content transmission bias or by a more general emotional content transmission bias.

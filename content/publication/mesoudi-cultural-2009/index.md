abstract: The observation that suicides sometimes cluster in space and/or time has
  led to suggestions that these clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide-related
  behaviours, or 'copycat suicides'. Point clusters are clusters of suicides localised
  in both time and space, and have been attributed to direct social learning from
  nearby individuals. Mass clusters are clusters of suicides localised in time but
  not space, and have been attributed to the dissemination of information concerning
  celebrity suicides via the mass media. Here, agent-based simulations, in combination
  with scan statistic methods for detecting clusters of rare events, were used to
  clarify the social learning processes underlying point and mass clusters. It was
  found that social learning between neighbouring agents did generate point clusters
  as predicted, although this effect was partially mimicked by homophily (individuals
  preferentially assorting with similar others). The one-to-many transmission dynamics
  characterised by the mass media were shown to generate mass clusters, but only where
  social learning was weak, perhaps due to prestige bias (only copying prestigious
  celebrities) and similarity bias (only copying similar models) acting to reduce
  the subset of available models. These findings can help to clarify and formalise
  existing hypotheses and to guide future empirical work relating to real-life copycat
  suicides.

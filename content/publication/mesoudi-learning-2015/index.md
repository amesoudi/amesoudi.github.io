abstract: This volume is motivated by the desire to explain why Neanderthals were
  replaced by modern humans, in terms of cultural differences between the two (sub-)
  species. It provides up-to-date coverage on the theory of cultural evolution as
  is being used by anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists and psychologists to
  decipher hominin cultural change and diversity during the Palaeolithic. The contributing
  authors are directly involved in this effort and the material presented includes
  novel approaches and findings. Chapters explain how learning strategies in combination
  with social and demographic factors (e.g., population size and mobility patterns)
  predict cultural evolution in a world without the printing press, television or
  the Internet. Also addressed is the inverse problem of how learning strategies may
  be inferred from actual trajectories of cultural change, for example as seen in
  the North American Palaeolithic. Mathematics and statistics, a sometimes necessary
  part of theory, are explained in elementary terms where they appear, with details
  relegated to appendices. Full citations of the relevant literature will help the
  reader to further pursue any topic of interest.

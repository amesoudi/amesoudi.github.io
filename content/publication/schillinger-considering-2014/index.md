abstract: Ethnographic research highlights that there are constraints placed on the
  time available to produce cultural artefacts in differing circumstances. Given that
  copying error, or cultural ‘mutation’, can have important implications for the evolutionary
  processes involved in material culture change, it is essential to explore empirically
  how such ‘time constraints’ affect patterns of artefactual variation. Here, we report
  an experiment that systematically tests whether, and how, varying time constraints
  affect shape copying error rates. A total of 90 participants copied the shape of
  a 3D ‘target handaxe form’ using a standardized foam block and a plastic knife.
  Three distinct ‘time conditions’ were examined, whereupon participants had either
  20, 15, or 10 minutes to complete the task. One aim of this study was to determine
  whether reducing production time produced a proportional increase in copy error
  rates across all conditions, or whether the concept of a task specific ‘threshold’
  might be a more appropriate manner to model the effect of time budgets on copy-error
  rates. We found that mean levels of shape copying error increased when production
  time was reduced. However, there were no statistically significant differences between
  the 20 minute and 15 minute conditions. Significant differences were only obtained
  between conditions when production time was reduced to 10 minutes. Hence, our results
  more strongly support the hypothesis that the effects of time constraints on copying
  error are best modelled according to a ‘threshold’ effect, below which mutation
  rates increase more markedly. Our results also suggest that ‘time budgets’ available
  in the past will have generated varying patterns of shape variation, potentially
  affecting spatial and temporal trends seen in the archaeological record. Hence,
  ‘time-budgeting’ factors need to be given greater consideration in evolutionary
  models of material culture change.

abstract: A Darwinian evolutionary approach to archaeology naturally leads to a focus
  on cultural transmission. Theoretical models of cultural evolution indicate that
  individual-level details of cultural transmission can have specific and significant
  population-level effects, implying that differences in transmission may be detectable
  in the archaeological record. Here we present an experimental simulation of the
  cultural transmission of prehistoric projectile-point technology, simulating the
  two transmission modes-indirect bias and guided variation-that Bettinger and Eerkens
  (1999) suggested were responsible for differences in Nevada and California point-attribute
  correlations. Groups of participants designed 'virtual projectile points' and tested
  them in 'virtual hunting environments,' with different phases of learning simulating,
  alternately, indirectly biased cultural transmission and independent individual
  learning. As predicted, periods of cultural transmission were associated with significantly
  stronger attribute correlations than were periods of individual learning. We also
  found that participants who could engage in indirectly biased horizontal cultural
  transmission outperformed individual-learning controls, especially when individual
  learning was costly and the selective environment was multimodal. The study demonstrates
  that experimental simulations of cultural transmission, used alongside archaeological
  data, mathematical models and computer simulations, constitute a useful tool for
  studying cultural change.

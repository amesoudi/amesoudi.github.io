abstract: Here I discuss two broad versions of human cultural evolution which currently
  exist in the literature and which emphasise different underlying dynamics. One,
  which originates in population-genetic-style modelling, emphasises how cultural
  selection causes some cultural variants to be favoured and gradually increase in
  frequency over others. The other, which draws more from cognitive science, holds
  that cultural change is driven by the biased transformation of cultural variants
  by individuals in non-random and consistent directions. Despite claims that cultural
  evolution is characterised by one or the other of these dynamics, these are neither
  mutually exclusive nor a dichotomy. Different domains of human culture are likely
  to be more or less characterised by cultural selection and biased transformation.
  Identifying cultural dynamics in real-world cultural data is challenging given that
  they can generate the same population-level patterns, such as directional change
  or cross-cultural stability, and the same cognitive and emotional mechanisms may
  underlie both cultural selection and biased transformation. Nevertheless, fine grained
  historical analysis and lab experiments, combined with formal models to generate
  quantitative predictions, offer the best way of distinguishing them.

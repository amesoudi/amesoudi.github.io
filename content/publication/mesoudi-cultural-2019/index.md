abstract: Cultural evolution is a branch of the evolutionary sciences which assumes
  that (i) human cognition and behaviour is shaped not only by genetic inheritance,
  but also cultural inheritance (also known as social learning), and (ii) this cultural
  inheritance constitutes a Darwinian evolutionary system that can be analysed and
  studied using tools borrowed from evolutionary biology. In this chapter I explore
  the numerous compatibilities between the fields of cultural evolution and cultural
  psychology, and the potential mutual benefits from their closer alignment. First,
  understanding the evolutionary context within which human psychology emerged gives
  added significance to the findings of cultural psychologists, which reinforce the
  conclusion reached by cultural evolution scholars that humans inhabit a ‘cultural
  niche’ within which the major means of adaptation to difference environments is
  cultural, rather than genetic. Hence, we should not be surprised that human psychology
  shows substantial cross-cultural variation. Second, a focus on cultural transmission
  pathways, drawing on cultural evolution models and empirical research, can help
  to explain to the maintenance of, and potential changes in, cultural variation in
  psychological processes. Evidence from migrants, in particular, points to a mix
  of vertical, oblique and horizontal cultural transmission that can explain the differential
  stability of different cultural dimensions. Third, cultural evolutionary methods
  offer powerful means of testing historical (“macro-evolutionary”) hypotheses put
  forward by cultural psychologists for the origin of psychological differences. Explanations
  in terms of means of subsistence, rates of environmental change or pathogen prevalence
  can be tested using quantitative models and phylogenetic analyses that can be used
  to reconstruct cultural lineages. Evolutionary considerations also point to potential
  problems with current cross-country comparisons conducted within cultural psychology,
  such as the non-independence of data points due to shared cultural history. Finally,
  I argue that cultural psychology can play a central role in a synthetic evolutionary
  science of culture, providing valuable links between individual-oriented disciplines
  such as experimental psychology and neuroscience on the one hand, and society-oriented
  disciplines such as anthropology, history and sociology on the other, all within
  an evolutionary framework that provides links to the biological sciences.

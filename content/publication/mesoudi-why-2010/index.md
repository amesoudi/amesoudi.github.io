abstract: At the inception of the social sciences in the late 19th century, early
  psychologists, anthropologists, archaeologists and sociologists frequently proposed
  evolutionary explanations for social phenomena. Yet by the mid-20th century Darwin's
  theory had virtually disappeared from the social sciences, and most social scientists
  continue to reject evolutionary approaches within their disciplines. This special
  issue of the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology contains six papers each of which
  addresses the question of why social scientists rejected evolution, and why they
  still do. Three broad reasons are identified by our contributors. First, many social
  scientists past and present hold distorted views of evolution leading to, in our
  view, an unfounded rejection of evolutionary theory. This distortion might be addressed
  by improved education and communication of evolutionary theory. Second, many past
  applications of evolutionary theory to social phenomena have been inadequate for
  explaining the kinds of phenomena that social scientists are most interested in,
  such as rapid cultural change and the emergence of large-scale cooperative institutions.
  This situation is changing as modern Darwinian approaches incorporate behavioural
  flexibility, group-level explanations and culture. Finally, certain strands of the
  social sciences have rejected the scientific method in general, instead adopting
  non-scientific perspectives such as social constructionism. While this is a broader
  epistemological issue, the application of evolutionary methods to social phenomena
  may provide the best and most direct support for the value of the scientific method.

abstract: Recent years have seen an enormous expansion and progress in studies of
  the cultural diffusion processes through which behaviour patterns, ideas and artifacts
  are transmitted within and between generations of humans and other animals. The
  first of two main approaches focuses on identifying, tracing and understanding cultural
  diffusion as it naturally occurs, an essential foundation to any science of culture.
  This endeavor has been enriched in recent years by sophisticated statistical methods
  and surprising new discoveries particularly in humans, other primates and cetaceans.
  This work has been complemented by a growing corpus of powerful, purpose-designed
  cultural diffusion experiments with captive and natural populations that have facilitated
  the rigorous identification and analysis of cultural diffusion in species from insects
  to humans.

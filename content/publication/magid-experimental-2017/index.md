abstract: 'Cultural psychologists have shown that people from Western countries exhibit
  more independent self-construal and analytic (rule-based) cognition than people
  from East Asia, who exhibit more interdependent self-construal and holistic (relationship-based)
  cognition. One explanation for this cross-cultural variation is the ecocultural
  hypothesis, which links contemporary psychological differences to ancestral differences
  in subsistence and societal cohesion: Western thinking formed in response to solitary
  herding, which fostered independence, while East Asian thinking emerged in response
  to communal rice farming, which fostered interdependence. Here, we report two experiments
  that tested the ecocultural hypothesis in the laboratory. In both, participants
  played one of two tasks designed to recreate the key factors of working alone and
  working together. Before and after each task, participants completed psychological
  measures of independent–interdependent self-construal and analytic–holistic cognition.
  We found no convincing evidence that either solitary or collective tasks affected
  any of the measures in the predicted directions. This fails to support the ecocultural
  hypothesis. However, it may also be that our priming tasks are inappropriate or
  inadequate for simulating subsistence-related behavioural practices, or that these
  measures are fixed early in development and therefore not experimentally primable,
  despite many previous studies that have purported to find such priming effects.'

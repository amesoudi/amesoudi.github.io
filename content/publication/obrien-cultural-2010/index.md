abstract: Cultural traits have long been used in anthropology as units of transmission
  that ostensibly reflect behavioural characteristics of the individuals or groups
  exhibiting the traits. After they are transmitted, cultural traits serve as units
  of replication in that they can be modified as part of an individual's cultural
  repertoire through processes such as recombination, loss or partial alteration within
  an individual's mind. Cultural traits are analogous to genes in that organisms replicate
  them, but they are also replicators in their own right. No one has ever seen a unit
  of transmission, either behavioural or genetic, although we can observe the effects
  of transmission. Fortunately, such units are manifest in artefacts, features and
  other components of the archaeological record, and they serve as proxies for studying
  the transmission (and modification) of cultural traits, provided there is analytical
  clarity over how to define and measure the units that underlie this inheritance
  process.

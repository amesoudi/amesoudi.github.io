abstract: Recent work in the fields of evolutionary ethics and moral psychology appears
  to be converging on a single empirically- and evolutionary-based science of morality
  or ethics. To date, however, these fields have failed to provide an adequate conceptualisation
  of how culture affects the content and distribution of moral norms. This is particularly
  important for a large class of moral norms relating to rapidly changing technological
  or social environments, such as norms regarding the acceptability of genetically
  modified organisms. Here we suggest that a science of morality/ethics can benefit
  from adopting a cultural evolution or gene-culture coevolution approach, which treats
  culture as a second, separate evolutionary system that acts in parallel to biological/genetic
  evolution. This cultural evolution approach brings with it a set of established
  theoretical concepts (e.g. different cultural transmission mechanisms) and empirical
  methods (e.g. evolutionary game theory) that can significantly improve our understanding
  of human morality.

abstract: Recent anthropological findings document how certain lowland South American
  societies hold beliefs in ‘partible paternity’, which allow children to have more
  than one ‘biological’ father. This contrasts with Western beliefs in ‘singular paternity’,
  and biological reality, where children have just one father. Here, mathematical
  models are used to explore the coevolution of paternity beliefs and the genetic
  variation underlying human mating behaviour. A gene–culture coevolutionary model
  found that populations exposed to a range of selection regimes typically converge
  on one of two simultaneously stable equilibria; one where the population is monogamous
  and believes in singular paternity, and the other where the population is polygamous
  and believes in partible paternity. A second agent-based model, with alternative
  assumptions regarding the formation of mating consortships, broadly replicated this
  finding in populations with a strongly female-biased sex ratio, consistent with
  evidence for high adult male mortality in the region. This supports an evolutionary
  scenario in which ancestral South American populations with differing paternity
  beliefs were subject to divergent selection on genetically influenced mating behaviour,
  facilitated by a female-biased sex ratio, leading to the present-day associations
  of female control, partible paternity and polygamy in some societies, and male control,
  singular paternity and monogamy in others.

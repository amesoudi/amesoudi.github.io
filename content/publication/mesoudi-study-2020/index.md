abstract: A source of continued tension within the evolutionary human behavioural
  / social sciences, as well as between these fields and the traditional social sciences,
  is how to conceptualise ‘culture’ in its various manifestations and guises. One
  of the earliest criticisms of E O Wilson’s sociobiology project was the focus on
  presumed genetically evolved behavioural universals, and lack of attention to cultural
  diversity and cultural (as opposed to genetic) history. As sociobiology split into
  different fields during the 1980s, each developed their own approaches and assumptions.
  Human behavioural ecologists employed the ‘phenotypic gambit’, assuming that culture
  is a proximate means by which natural selection generates currently-adaptive behavioural
  strategies. Evolutionary psychologists distinguished between transmitted and evoked
  culture, the former involving the social transmission of information, the latter
  involving the triggering of genetically-prespecified behaviours in response to different
  environmental cues (typically ancestral cues, such that behaviour may no longer
  be currently adaptive). Evoked culture has been the focus of most research in evolutionary
  psychology. Cognitive anthropologists have a similar notion of ‘cultural attraction’,
  where universal aspects of cognition evoke predictable responses due to individual
  learning. Finally, cultural evolution (or gene-culture coevolution) approaches stress
  the causal role of transmitted culture. Here, human cognition is assumed to be relatively
  domain-general and content-free, with genetic evolution having shaped social learning
  processes to allow the rapid spread of locally adaptive knowledge (although occasionally
  allowing the spread of maladaptive behaviour, due to the partial decoupling of genetic
  and cultural evolution). All the while, the traditional social sciences have remained
  steadfastly unwilling to accept that evolutionary approaches to human behaviour
  have any merit or relevance, and indeed have abandoned the scientific method in
  favour of more politically motivated interpretive methods. Most curiously, the social
  sciences have abandoned the concept of culture, as they define it. I will discuss
  all of these approaches in terms of (i) the extent to which they give causal weight
  to genetic inheritance, individual learning and social learning, and how these process
  interact; (ii) their assumptions about the domain-specificity of human cognition;
  (iii) ultimate-proximate causation; (iv) specific debates over language evolution,
  cooperation and the demographic transition; and (v) prospects for reconciliation
  and integration of these tensions across the evolutionary human sciences and the
  social sciences more broadly.

abstract: Sexual selection has resulted in sex-based size dimorphism in many mammals,
  including humans. In Western societies, average to taller stature men and comparatively
  shorter, slimmer women have higher reproductive success and are typically considered
  more attractive. This size dimorphism also extends to vocalisations in many species,
  again including humans, with larger individuals exhibiting lower formant frequencies
  than smaller individuals. Further, across many languages there are associations
  between phonemes and the expression of size (e.g. large /a, o/, small /i, e/), consistent
  with the frequency-size relationship in vocalisations. We suggest that naming preferences
  are a product of this frequency-size relationship, driving male names to sound larger
  and female names smaller, through sound symbolism. In a 10-year dataset of the most
  popular British, Australian and American names we show that male names are significantly
  more likely to contain larger sounding phonemes (e.g. “Thomas”), while female names
  are significantly more likely to contain smaller phonemes (e.g. “Emily”). The desire
  of parents to have comparatively larger, more masculine sons, and smaller, more
  feminine daughters, and the increased social success that accompanies more sex-stereotyped
  names, is likely to be driving English-language first names to exploit sound symbolism
  of size in line with sexual body size dimorphism.

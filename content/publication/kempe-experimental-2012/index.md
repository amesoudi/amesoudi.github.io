abstract: Archaeologists interested in explaining changes in artifact morphology over
  long time periods have found it useful to create models in which the only source
  of change is random and unintentional copying error, or ‘cultural mutation’. These
  models can be used as null hypotheses against which to detect non-random processes
  such as cultural selection or biased transmission. One proposed cultural mutation
  model is the accumulated copying error model, where individuals attempt to copy
  the size of another individual's artifact exactly but make small random errors due
  to physiological limits on the accuracy of their perception. Here, we first derive
  the model within an explicit mathematical framework, generating the predictions
  that multiple independently-evolving artifact chains should diverge over time such
  that their between-chain variance increases while the mean artifact size remains
  constant. We then present the first experimental test of this model in which 200
  participants, split into 20 transmission chains, were asked to faithfully copy the
  size of the previous participant's handaxe image on an iPad. The experimental findings
  supported the model's prediction that between-chain variance should increase over
  time and did so in a manner quantitatively in line with the model. However, when
  the initial size of the image that the participants resized was larger than the
  size of the image they were copying, subjects tended to increase the size of the
  image, resulting in the mean size increasing rather than staying constant. This
  suggests that items of material culture formed by reductive vs. additive processes
  may mutate differently when individuals attempt to replicate faithfully the size
  of previously-produced artifacts. Finally, we show that a dataset of 2601 Acheulean
  handaxes shows less variation than predicted given our empirically measured copying
  error variance, suggesting that other processes counteracted the variation in handaxe
  size generated by perceptual cultural mutation.

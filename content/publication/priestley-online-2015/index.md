abstract: Online votes or ratings can assist internet users in evaluating the credibility
  and appeal of the information which they encounter. For example, aggregator websites
  such as Reddit allow users to up-vote submitted content to make it more prominent,
  and down-vote content to make it less prominent. Here we argue that decisions over
  what to up- or down-vote may be guided by evolved features of human cognition. We
  predict that internet users should be more likely to up-vote content that others
  have also up-voted (social influence), content that has been submitted by particularly
  liked or respected users (model-based bias), content that constitutes evolutionarily
  salient or relevant information (content bias), and content that follows group norms
  and, in particular, prosocial norms. 489 respondents from the online social voting
  community Reddit rated the extent to which they felt different traits influenced
  their voting. Statistical analyses confirmed that norm-following and prosociality,
  as well as various content biases such as emotional content and originality, were
  rated as important motivators of voting. Social influence had a smaller effect than
  expected, while attitudes towards the submitter had little effect. This exploratory
  empirical investigation suggests that online voting communities can provide an important
  test-bed for evolutionary theories of human social information use, and that evolved
  features of human cognition may guide online behaviour just as it guides behaviour
  in the offline world.

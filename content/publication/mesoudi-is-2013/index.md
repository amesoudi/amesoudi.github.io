abstract: What role does non-genetic inheritance play in evolution? In recent work
  we have independently and collectively argued that the existence and scope of non-genetic
  inheritance systems, including epigenetic inheritance, niche construction/ecological
  inheritance, and cultural inheritance—alongside certain other theory revisions—necessitates
  an extension to the neo-Darwinian Modern Synthesis (MS) in the form of an Extended
  Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). However, this argument has been challenged on the
  grounds that non-genetic inheritance systems are exclusively proximate mechanisms
  that serve the ultimate function of calibrating organisms to stochastic environments.
  In this paper we defend our claims, pointing out that critics of the EES (1) conflate
  non-genetic inheritance with early 20th-century notions of soft inheritance; (2)
  misunderstand the nature of the EES in relation to the MS; (3) confuse individual
  phenotypic plasticity with trans-generational non-genetic inheritance; (4) fail
  to address the extensive theoretical and empirical literature which shows that non-genetic
  inheritance can generate novel targets for selection, create new genetic equilibria
  that would not exist in the absence of non-genetic inheritance, and generate phenotypic
  variation that is independent of genetic variation; (5) artificially limit ultimate
  explanations for traits to gene-based selection, which is unsatisfactory for phenotypic
  traits that originate and spread via non-genetic inheritance systems; and (6) fail
  to provide an explanation for biological organization. We conclude by noting ways
  in which we feel that an overly gene-centric theory of evolution is hindering progress
  in biology and other sciences.

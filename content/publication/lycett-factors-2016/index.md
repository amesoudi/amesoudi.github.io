abstract: The 'Acheulean' is comprised of individual knapping events undertaken by
  individual hominins. In other words, it is a particular component of hominin behavior
  that we draw out and amalgamate into a wider “pattern.” The resultant phenomenon
  (i.e., “the Acheulean”) is an entity that stretches over the space of three continents
  and spans a time period in excess of one million years. If such an exercise has
  any merit, it is because it provides a means of comparative (behavioral) analysis
  over these swathes of time and space. Comparative research can document, measure,
  and statistically assess temporo-spatial patterns of artifactual variation, and
  so test hypotheses regarding the character of that variation. However, it does not
  provide an independent means of examining some of the key phenomena which it is
  necessary to further understand in order to increase our comprehension of this archaeological
  legacy. Here, we review and synthesize recent experimental work that we have undertaken,
  which has specifically investigated some of the factors potentially responsible
  for the generation and constraint of variation within the Acheulean techno-complex.
  We examine issues of raw material, copying errors, and their relationship to mechanisms
  of social learning. Understanding these microevolutionary factors via experiments,
  we contend, is essential in order to reach a secure understanding of the macroscale
  phenomenon typically referred to as the “Acheulean.” Moreover, we outline how a
  “quantitative genetic” framework to these issues provides an essential means of
  linking these inherent micro- and macro-evolutionary factors into a coherent whole,
  while also simultaneously reconciling the potential influence of different sources
  of variation that are part of a temporally and geographically dispersed entity such
  as the Acheulean.

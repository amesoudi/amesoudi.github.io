abstract: One of the hallmarks of the human species is our capacity for cumulative
  culture, in which beneficial knowledge and technology is accumulated over successive
  generations. Yet previous analyses of cumulative cultural change have failed to
  consider the possibility that as cultural complexity accumulates, it becomes increasingly
  costly for each new generation to acquire from the previous generation. In principle
  this may result in an upper limit on the cultural complexity that can be accumulated,
  at which point accumulated knowledge is so costly and time-consuming to acquire
  that further innovation is not possible. In this paper I first review existing empirical
  analyses of the history of science and technology that support the possibility that
  cultural acquisition costs may constrain cumulative cultural evolution. I then present
  macroscopic and individual-based models of cumulative cultural evolution that explore
  the consequences of this assumption of variable cultural acquisition costs, showing
  that making acquisition costs vary with cultural complexity causes the latter to
  reach an upper limit above which no further innovation can occur. These models further
  explore the consequences of different cultural transmission rules (directly biased,
  indirectly biased and unbiased transmission), population size, and cultural innovations
  that themselves reduce innovation or acquisition costs.

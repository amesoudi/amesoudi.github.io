abstract: It has been proposed that one reason for the success of Homo sapiens is
  our advanced learning abilities. Theoretical models suggest that complex cultural
  adaptations can arise from an optimal mix of (1) individual learning that is of
  sufficient accuracy plus (2) social learning that is of sufficiently high fidelity
  and is payoff-biased. Here I review the findings of a series of experimental studies
  of human learning, designed to simulate the kind of technology-based tasks that
  our ancestors would have faced. Results of these studies support the predictions
  of the models, and show that contemporary humansâ€™ learning strategies are broadly
  adaptive. Performance typically improves through effective individual learning and
  payoff-biased social learning. The latter crucially allows participants to escape
  low-fitness locally optimal artifact designs and jump to higher-fitness designs,
  assuming a realistic multimodal adaptive landscape underlying artifact fitness.
  On the other hand, people also exhibited predictable flaws in their learning, such
  as the copying of neutral traits exhibited by successful models along with their
  functional traits (i.e., cultural hitchhiking), and an unwillingness to share information
  with others under certain circumstances.

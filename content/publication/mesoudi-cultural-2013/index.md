abstract: "This chapter explores how the principles and methods of cultural evolution
  can inform our understanding of technology and science. Both technology and science
  are prime examples of cumulative cultural evolution, with each generation preserving
  and building upon the achievements of prior generations. A key benefit of an evolutionary
  approach to technological or scientific change is 'population thinking,' where broad
  trends and patterns are explained in terms of individual-level mechanisms of variation,
  selection, and transmission. This chapter outlines some of these mechanisms and
  their implications for technological change, including sources of innovation, types
  of social learning, facilitatory developmental factors, and cultural transmission
  mechanisms. The role of external representations and human-constructed environments
  in technological evolution are explored, and factors are examined which determine
  the varying rates of technological change over time: from intrinsic characteristics
  of single technological traits, such as efficacy or manufacturing cost, to larger
  social and population-level factors, such as population size or social institutions.
  Science can be viewed as both a product of cultural evolution as well as a form
  of cultural evolution in its own right. Science and technology constitute separate
  yet interacting evolutionary processes. Outstanding issues and promising avenues
  for future investigation are highlighted and potential applications of this work
  are noted."

abstract: Our species has the peculiar ability to accumulate cultural innovations
  over multiple generations, a phenomenon termed ‘cumulative cultural evolution’ (CCE).
  Recent years have seen a proliferation of empirical and theoretical work exploring
  the interplay between demography and CCE. This has generated intense discussion
  about whether demographic models can help explain historical patterns of cultural
  changes. Here, we synthesize empirical and theoretical studies from multiple fields
  to highlight how both population size and structure can shape the pool of cultural
  information that individuals can build upon to innovate, present the potential pathways
  through which humans’ unique social structure might promote CCE, and discuss whether
  humans’ social networks might partly result from selection pressures linked to our
  extensive reliance on culturally accumulated knowledge.

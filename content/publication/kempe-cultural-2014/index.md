abstract: Diverse species exhibit cultural traditions, i.e. population-specific profiles
  of socially learned traits, from songbird dialects to primate tool-use behaviours.
  However, only humans appear to possess cumulative culture, in which cultural traits
  increase in complexity over successive generations. Theoretically, it is currently
  unclear what factors give rise to these phenomena, and consequently why cultural
  traditions are found in several species but cumulative culture in only one. Here,
  we address this by constructing and analysing cultural evolutionary models of both
  phenomena that replicate empirically attestable levels of cultural variation and
  complexity in chimpanzees and humans. In our model of cultural traditions (Model
  1), we find that realistic cultural variation between populations can be maintained
  even when individuals in different populations invent the same traits and migration
  between populations is frequent, and under a range of levels of social learning
  accuracy. This lends support to claims that putative cultural traditions are indeed
  cultural (rather than genetic) in origin, and suggests that cultural traditions
  should be widespread in species capable of social learning. Our model of cumulative
  culture (Model 2) indicates that both the accuracy of social learning and the number
  of cultural demonstrators interact to determine the complexity of a trait that can
  be maintained in a population. Combining these models (Model 3) creates two qualitatively
  distinct regimes in which there are either a few, simple traits, or many, complex
  traits. We suggest that these regimes correspond to nonhuman and human cultures,
  respectively. The rarity of cumulative culture in nature may result from this interaction
  between social learning accuracy and number of demonstrators.

abstract: 'The modern field of cultural evolution is now over 30 years old, and an
  extensive body of theory and data has been amassed. This article reviews models
  of cultural evolution, both experimental and theoretical, and surveys what they
  can tell us about cultural evolutionary processes. The models are grouped according
  to which of four broad questions they address: (1) How are cultural traits changed
  during transmission? (2) How and why do cultural traits accumulate over time? (3)
  What social learning biases do people use? and (4) What are the population?level
  consequences of different social learning biases? We conclude by highlighting gaps
  in the literature and promising future research directions, including the further
  integration of theoretical models and experimental data, the identification of the
  factors underlying cumulative cultural evolution, and the explanation of individual
  and cultural variation in social learning biases.'

abstract: The papers in this special issue of Human Biology address recent research
  in the field of language evolution, both the genetic evolution of the language faculty
  and the cultural evolution of specific languages. While both of these areas have
  received increasing interest in recent years, there is also a need to integrate
  these somewhat separate efforts and explore the relevant gene-culture revolutionary
  interactions. Here we summarize the individual contributions, set them in the context
  of the wider literature, and identify outstanding future research questions. The
  first set of papers concerns the comparative study of nonhuman communication in
  primates and birds from both a behavioral and neurobiological perspective, revealing
  evidence for several common language-related traits in various nonhuman species
  and providing clues as to the evolutionary origin and function of the human language
  faculty. The second set of papers discusses the consequences of viewing language
  as a culturally evolving system in its own right, including claims that this removes
  the need for strong genetic biases for language acquisition, and that phylogenetic
  evolutionary methods can be used to reconstruct language histories. We conclude
  by highlighting outstanding areas for future research, including identifying the
  precise selection pressures that gave rise to the language faculty in ancestral
  hominin species, and determining the strength, domain specificity, and origin of
  the cultural transmission biases that shape languages as they pass along successive
  generations of language learners.

abstract: In this introductory chapter, we first provide some background on the two
  major recurrent themes of the volume, i.e. learning strategies of individuals, and
  social and demographic characteristics of populations. This is followed by a brief
  summary of each chapter. Then, we conclude with some thoughts on why and how the
  methods and findings presented in this volume are relevant to, and might inform
  our understanding of, the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans (Homo sapiens).

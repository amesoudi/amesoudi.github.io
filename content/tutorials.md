        This tutorial shows how to create very simple simulation or agent-based models of cultural evolution in R. It uses the RStudio notebook or RMarkdown (.Rmd) format, allowing you to execute code as you read the explanatory text. Each model is contained in a separate RMarkdown file which you can open in RStudio. Currently these are:

        * Model 1: Unbiased transmission
        * Model 2: Unbiased and biased mutation
        * Model 3: Biased transmission (direct/content bias)
        * Model 4: Biased transmission (indirect bias)
        * Model 5: Biased transmission (conformist bias)
        * Model 6: Vertical and horizontal transmission
        * Model 7: Migration
        * Model 8: Blending inheritance
        * Model 9: Demography and cultural gain/loss
        * Model 10: Polarization
        * Model 11: Cultural group selection
        * Model 12: Historical dynamics
        * Model 13: Social contagion
        * Model 14: Social networks
        * Model 15: Opinion formation
        * Model 16: Bayesian iterated learning
        * Model 17: Reinforcement learning
        * Model 18: Evolution of social learning
        * Model 19: Evolution of social learning strategies
        
        The tutorial is freely available at https://github.com/amesoudi/cultural_evolution_ABM_tutorial
        
        An online version which contains the compiled models with outputs can be found at https://bookdown.org/amesoudi/ABMtutorial_bookdown/

      text: |-
    This tutorial shows how to create very simple simulation or agent-based models of cultural evolution in R. It uses the RStudio notebook or RMarkdown (.Rmd) format, allowing you to execute code as you read the explanatory text. Each model is contained in a separate RMarkdown file which you can open in RStudio.
    The tutorial is freely available <a href="https://github.com/amesoudi/cultural_evolution_ABM_tutorial">in this github repository</a>. An online version which contains the compiled models with outputs can be found at <a href="https://bookdown.org/amesoudi/ABMtutorial_bookdown/">on this bookdown site</a>.

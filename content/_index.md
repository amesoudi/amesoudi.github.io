        <h4>1. Cultural Evolution</h4>
        <p><img src="/uploads/book_cover.png" alt="Cultural Evolution book cover" style="width:200px;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px;float:right;">The human species has an extraordinary reliance on culture, i.e. the vast body of beliefs, knowledge and skills that we acquire from other individuals via social learning. While other species adapt to their environments primarily via genetic evolution, we adapt via cultural evolution. I am interested in how this process of cultural evolution works, its similarities and differences to genetic evolution, and how traditional social science findings and topics can be studied within an evolutionary framework.</p>

      title: 'Simulation models of cultural evolution in R'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        <img src="/uploads/sim.png" alt="Screenshots of cultural evolution simulations"> <a href="https://github.com/amesoudi/cultural_evolution_ABM_tutorial">This tutorial</a> shows how to create very simple simulation or agent-based models of cultural evolution in R. It uses the RStudio notebook or RMarkdown (.Rmd) format, allowing you to execute code as you read the explanatory text. Each model is contained in a separate RMarkdown file which you can open in RStudio. Currently these are:

        * Model 1: Unbiased transmission
        * Model 2: Unbiased and biased mutation
        * Model 3: Biased transmission (direct/content bias)
        * Model 4: Biased transmission (indirect bias)
        * Model 5: Biased transmission (conformist bias)
        * Model 6: Vertical and horizontal transmission
        * Model 7: Migration
        * Model 8: Blending inheritance
        * Model 9: Demography and cultural gain/loss
        * Model 10: Polarization
        * Model 11: Cultural group selection
        * Model 12: Historical dynamics
        * Model 13: Social contagion
        * Model 14: Social networks
        * Model 15: Opinion formation
        * Model 16: Bayesian iterated learning
        * Model 17: Reinforcement learning
        * Model 18: Evolution of social learning
        * Model 19: Evolution of social learning strategies
        
        The tutorial is freely available <a href="https://github.com/amesoudi/cultural_evolution_ABM_tutorial">in this github repository</a>. An online version which contains the compiled models with outputs can be found <a href="https://bookdown.org/amesoudi/ABMtutorial_bookdown/">on this bookdown site</a>.
